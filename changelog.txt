Changes from 1.8.0 to 1.9.0:
commit 19df4cbd1

    Upgrade to PolarSSL 1.3.0 

commit 21d4cc95b

    Change flags for building .so on macports (A new sample filter broke the
    old options)

commit e61fee3e7

    Add an option to stream large uploads to a handler using a token credit
    system to prevent over-buffering.

commit 3a58aa0da

    Add an option ssl.verify_required to mandate client certificate
    verification

commit 9024156ad

    Add a control XREQ type; only supported option is a keep-alive which acts
    as a "ping" for the mongrel2 idle connection killer

commit 854cff6e9

    Add mongrel2 header field "REMOTE_ADDR" with the actual remote from
    mongrel2.
    Add option "no_clobber_xff" which will preserve the x-forwarded-for field
    from the client/upstream proxy.

    Old behavior was to replace the x-forwarded-for header with the remote
    address to mongrel2.  This new way is better since it still allows a
    trusted field (REMOTE_ADDR) while also preserving x-forwarded-for for
    setups that include (for instance) a load-balancer or external
    ssl-terminator.

    We don't replace the old behavior for x-forwarded-for unless requested,
    since older handlers may trust that header.

commit b82451f343

    Add ability to have a separate control port for each server


commit ea6a9cd729

    This was hotfixed-into 1.8.1 and fixed some bugs in how the deliver task
    gets killed.

commit ef1c601777
    
    Add a few MIME type mappings

commit 89ed061396

    Adds TLS SNI identification

    In the certdir, place e.g. example.com.key and example.com.crt to have SNI
    work.  1.9.0 should fall back on the old key/crt files if these aren't
    found

commit 81bf4ac84ba

    Adds a new "Extended" handler reply format, and a plugin system to hook
    into them.  A sample plugin was created that will do x-sendfile like
    responses (The handler sends the proper headers, then an extended reply
    keyed to the plugin, which causes mongrel2 to dump a file to the
    connection)

commit 82b3ab000dc

    Docs fixes for ubuntu installation instructions

commit 24b2ed3936a

    A number of either completely or nearly non-functional changes to make
    a static analyzer happy.

commit 89e1f43f545

    Add ability for filters to rewrite headers going to proxy connections

    This allows, for example mod_rewrite like ability in filters

commit 5150a0583c1

    Modification to Python zmq library to allow forwarding of raw 0mq message
    
commit 82a26a67c04

    Bugfix for when a connection first goes to proxy and then a zmq handler
    
commit 861cdf36f585

    Add configuration option to prevent forking
    Makes a lot of process management tools happier
